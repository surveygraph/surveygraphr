Description: A tool for computing network representations of attitudes,
  extracted from tabular data such as sociological surveys. Development of
  surveygraph software and training materials was initially funded by the
  European Union under the ERC Proof-of-concept programme (ERC,
  Attitude-Maps-4-All, project number: 101069264). Views and opinions expressed
  are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily reflect those
  of the European Union or the European Research Council Executive Agency.
  Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can be held responsible
  for them.
